# Class :

  - Class is defination block which is used to define the States and behabiours of an Objects.
  - Non-Static memebrs of the class represents the States of an object
  - Non-Static methods of the class represents the behavours of an Object
  - Class is logical entity
  - Class is blue print of an Object

  - In another way we can define class as
  - Class is Java Type Program which has 2 parts
      1. Class declaration
      2. Class Body
  - class declaration includes
      - Access Specifiers
      - Class keyword
      - Class Name
  - Anything defined in the class is known as 'Members of the class ' i.e. class body
  - Members of the class aare classified onto 2 types
      - Member Variables
      - Member Functions

  **1. Member Variables :**
      - The variables which are declared inside the class and outside the member function are called as Member variable
      - Member Variables get default initialization by the compiler
      - Member Variables are classified into 2 types
          1. Static Member variables
          2. Non-Static Member variables
      - Static member variables are accessed by the class name
      - Non-Static Member variables are accessed with the help of Objects

  **2. Member Functions :**
      - The function which are declared inside the class is known as Member functions
      - There are 2 types of Member functions
          1. Static Member functions
          2. Non-Static Member functions
      - Static Member functions are accessed by the class name
      - Non-Static Member functions are accessed with the help of Objects

# Objects 

  - Object i san entity which has it's own States and behaviours
  - States are nothing but Information About an Object
  - Behaviours are nothing but Operations can be performed on the State of an Objects
  - Object is Physical Entity
  - ex. Pen
    - States of Pen are , it's color , brand , price , etc..
    - Behaviour of Pen is ' writting '
  - In other words An Object is an exact copy of class
