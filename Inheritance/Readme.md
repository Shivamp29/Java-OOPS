# Inheritance 

  - The process of aquiring the properties of the supercalss into the subclass is known as 'Inheritance'
  - Inheritance can be achieved with the help of " extends " keyword
  - The class from which the properties are inherited to the subclass is known as 'Supercalss' or 'Parent Calss' or 'Base Class'
  - The class to which the properties are inherited is known as 'Subclass' or 'Child class' or 'Derived class'
  - Only the non-Static members of the class are inherited
  - The Static members of the class are not inherited because they are related to class and have only one copy
  - The Constructor of the class can not be inherited because the constructor has the same name as the class name
  - The private Non-Static Members of the class Can not inherited because private access specifier has access only within the class

**Tyoes of Iheritance :**
  - There are 5 tyoes of inheritance which are as follows
      1. Single level inheritance
      2. Multi level inheritance
      3. Mulitple inheritance
      4. Heirarchial inheritance
      5. Hybrid iheritance
   

**1. Single level inheritance :**
  - In this one subclass inheriting the properties of the one super class is known as Single level iheritance.
  - ex.
    check the file ' SingleInheritance.java '

**2. Multi level inheritance :**
  - In this one subclass is inheriting the properties of one super class which inherites the properties of another super class is known as Multi level inheritance.
  - ex.
      check the file ' MultiLevelInheritance.java '

**3. Mulitple inheritance :**
  - In this one subclass is inheriting the properties of two different super classes is known as Multiple inheritance
  - This is not Possible in Java because it creates a 'Diamond Problem '

**4. Heirarchial inheritance :**
  - In this two different Subclasses inheriting the properties of one super class is known as Heirarchial Inheritance.
  - ex.
      check the file ' Heirarchialinheritance.java ' 

**5. Hybrid iheritance :**
  - A combination of any one of the type of above inheritance is known as Hybrid Inheritance
